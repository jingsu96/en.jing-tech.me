Hello, everyone! I'm Jing and I'm delighted to meet you all here. I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at Houzz, with a main focus on frontend. My hobbies and interests include programming, reading, mountain climbing, fitness, and writing.

The purpose of creating this blog is to connect with friends who share the same interests through blogging. Here, I will periodically share what I've learned. Recently, I've been particularly interested in studying topics related to Functional Programming, React, Site Improvement, and Micro Frontend.

I plan to move to the UK in mid-2025, so I will start sharing my entire preparation process. If you have the chance, I hope you can also share your UK experience with me.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at [jing.tech.tw](mailto://jing.tech.tw@gmail.com), I will do my best to respond!
